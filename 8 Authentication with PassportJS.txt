What is Redis?
--------------

* Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker.
* Redis is designed to support different kinds of abstract data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperlogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

We are going to store our user's session information in Redis, and not in the process's memory. This way our application will be a lot easier to scale.

* Use Passport Module
